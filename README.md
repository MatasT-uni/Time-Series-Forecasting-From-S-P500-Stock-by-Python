# Financial Engineering: Time Series Forecasting

This project is dedicated to forecasting future values of financial time series data, specifically focusing on the S&P 500. The workflow involves preprocessing the data, handling non-trading days, and applying advanced forecasting techniques to predict future market trends.

## Project Overview

### 1. Import Libraries and Install Dependencies
Before beginning the analysis, this section ensures that all required Python libraries are imported and that dependencies are properly installed. This step is crucial for setting up the environment needed for time series analysis and forecasting.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
To ensure accurate forecasting, the data must be clean and appropriately structured. This section includes:
- **Data Loading**: Retrieving the necessary financial time series data, specifically focusing on the S&P 500.
- **Excluding Non-Trading Days**: Removing non-trading days from the dataset to prevent inaccuracies in the forecasting models.
- **Initial Data Checks**: Performing essential checks to clean the data, identify any anomalies, and prepare it for analysis.

### 3. Time Series Forecasting
This section applies various time series forecasting techniques to predict future trends based on historical financial data. The models implemented include:

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: A standard model used for analyzing and forecasting time series data, focusing on the relationship between past values and forecasted future values.

- **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**: An extension of ARIMA that accounts for seasonality in the data, making it more suitable for datasets with recurring patterns over time.

- **SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA with Exogenous Variables)**: Similar to SARIMA, but includes external variables (exogenous factors) that might influence the forecasted values, providing a more comprehensive model.

- **ARIMAX (ARIMA with Exogenous Variables)**: An extension of ARIMA that includes exogenous variables, allowing for additional predictors to influence the forecasts.

- **Holt-Winters (Triple Exponential Smoothing)**: A model that applies exponential smoothing to capture level, trend, and seasonality in time series data, often used for seasonal datasets.

- **Naive Forecasting**: A simple baseline model where the forecast for any period is equal to the last observed value. This model is often used as a benchmark to compare the performance of more complex models.

### 4. Model Comparison and Evaluation
After applying these models, the results are compared using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). This comparison helps in selecting the best model for forecasting based on the specific characteristics of the financial data.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Set Up Your Environment**: If you're using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), follow these steps to set up your environment:

   a. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

   b. **Install Visual Studio Code**: If you haven't already, download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

   c. **Install Python Extension for VS Code**: In VS Code, go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`. Search for "Python" and install the official Python extension by Microsoft.

   d. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended): Open VS Code and navigate to your project folder. Open the terminal in VS Code by selecting `View > Terminal` or pressing `` Ctrl+` ``. Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:
   
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```
   
   - **On Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **On macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Once your virtual environment is activated (if you chose to use one), manually install the required Python libraries by running the following commands in the VS Code terminal:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy yfinance matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn pmdarima pandas_datareader
   ```

   This command covers all the libraries used in your project:

   - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
   - `numpy` for numerical operations.
   - `yfinance` for retrieving financial data from Yahoo Finance.
   - `matplotlib` for data visualization.
   - `seaborn` for statistical data visualization.
   - `statsmodels` for statistical modeling, including time series analysis and forecasting models like ARIMA, SARIMAX, Holt-Winters, etc.
   - `scikit-learn` (installed by `sklearn`) for machine learning utilities, including metrics like mean squared error and mean absolute error.
   - `pmdarima` for additional time series analysis tools, including automated ARIMA model selection.
   - `pandas_datareader` for reading financial data from various online sources.

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:

   a. **Install Jupyter**: If Jupyter is not already installed, you can install it by running:
   
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

   b. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: Still in the VS Code terminal, launch the Jupyter Notebook interface by running:
   
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This command will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser.

4. **Run the Notebook**: In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to your project directory and open the `FinancialEngineering_TimeSeriesForecasting.ipynb` file. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially by clicking on each cell and pressing `Shift+Enter`, or by selecting `Cell > Run All` to run all cells at once.

5. **Analyze the Results**: Once the models have run, analyze the output plots and metrics to interpret the forecasted trends. These insights can help in making informed financial decisions.
